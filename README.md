# voronoi

A testbed for a Voronoi diagram approach to monodromy and homology.

**Idea:** compute the Voronoi diagram on the branch point structure of a plane
algebraic curve. Using these data we can efficiently compute the monodromy group
of the curve and, from there, a basis for the first homology group. This
approach allows one to maximally re-use analtyic continuation information.
